A few words from the coders of this website:

- *As vanilla as possible* - we think coding for the web should be fun and hands on, embracing modern web standards helps you avoid overhead and hiding complexity under layers of frameworks.
- *Minimalism is simplicity* - minimalism is the art of identifying and using only what you need. It may not always be easy. But we think this keeps things simple.
- *Patterns over frameworks* - a great framework is a great framework. React is one of those. But we are curious about the innovation that happens outside the norm. We like to support the initiatives that distills the greatness of the framework giants into something that is more hands on.

## Build and deploy
It's important to start the app with 'npm start ...' in order to set the 'process.env' variables correctly. Eg. otherwise the process.env.npm_package_version will be undefined.
